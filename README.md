# core-model

Working installations of RADMC-3D 2.0 and radmc3dpy are required.

#The model
This codebase generates and runs the necessary input files for a radmc3d model of a dust core heated by a single star at its center. It uses a 3D cartesian grid and a gaussian density distribution with gaussian fluctuations for the density grid.
